# Facial Emotion Recognition App

This project is a Streamlit-based web application for recognizing facial emotions from webcam captures or uploaded images. The application uses OpenCV for image processing, a pre-trained model from `timm` for emotion prediction, and `face_recognition` for face detection.

## Introduction

The Facial Emotion Recognition App captures or uploads images, detects faces, and predicts emotions using a deep learning model. This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision, deep learning, and web technologies.

## Features

- Capture images from webcam
- Upload images for processing
- Detect faces in the images
- Predict emotions using a pre-trained deep learning model
- Display results with bounding boxes around detected faces

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-emotion-recognition.git
    cd facial-emotion-recognition
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the model weights:**

    Ensure that the `path_to_your_model_weights.pth` file is available in the repository as per the path specified.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Access the app in your web browser:**

    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. **Use the app:**

    - Select "Webcam" to capture an image from your webcam.
    - Select "Upload Picture" to upload an image from your computer.
    - The app will detect faces and predict emotions, displaying the results.
